# Burned Area Experiments With Google Earth Engine (GEE)
These are the [Google Earh Engine](https://earthengine.google.com) scripts used in my [APDC investigação](https://sites.google.com/campus.fct.unl.pt/apdc-inv-2018) project, at [FCT-UNL](https://www.fct.unl.pt/en).
These scripts run in the [online code editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com), you may need to register in order to use the platform.
